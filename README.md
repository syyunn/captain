## About this Project

This project is to simplify the different classes in our economy and to track the instances of those classes easily with simple code-blocks. 


## Trackees

##### actor 

    1) any instance that holds state-backed right of possession 
    2) any instance that holds physical power to guarantee one's possession 

##### market 

    institution that enable any instances being exchanged by different actors via any kind of money

##### money 

    1) any state-backed tokens that provides exchange-ability between actors in market
    2) any tech-based tokens that provides exchange-ability between actors in market
    
##### phisikas 

    anything can be touched and possibly combined with other/same class-instance to generate another instance

##### non-phisikas 

    anything cannot be touched but possibly be combined with other/same class-instance to generate another instance

##### time 

    opportunity cost generator for every class instances - such as actor, money, phisikas and non-phisikas
